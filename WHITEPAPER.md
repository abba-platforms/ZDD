## Introduction

The Zimbabwe Digital Dollar (ZDD) is a USD-pegged stablecoin created to provide Zimbabwean citizens, businesses, and government institutions with a secure, transparent, and programmable digital currency. ZDD is created by Simon Kapenda, creator of Namibia Digital Dollar (NADD) - https://github.com/abba-platforms/nadd, Angola Digital Kwanza (AOAk) - https://github.com/abba-platforms/aoak, and CillarCoin (https://cillar.io), with ongoing maintenance and support by Abba Platforms Inc.

### Objectives:
- Provide a fully USD-backed digital currency
- Enable transparent, auditable transactions
- Support enterprise payrolls, government disbursements, and cross-border remittances
- Ensure regulatory compliance with tiered KYC and AML

---

## Background: Zimbabwe’s Monetary Landscape

- Historical Instability: Hyperinflation, multiple redenominations, and eventual dollarization
- Banking Access: Limited banking penetration and high remittance costs
- Digital Payment Landscape: Fragmented mobile money solutions with partial regulatory oversight

ZDD addresses these issues by providing a fully backed, auditable, and programmable stablecoin.

## Why ZDD?

### Motivation
- Stability: USD 1:1 peg mitigates volatility
- Security: Enterprise-grade smart contract architecture
- Accessibility: Digital wallets for individuals and businesses
- Compliance: Tiered KYC ensures regulatory adherence
- Programmability: Supports payroll, e-commerce, government disbursements, and cross-border remittances

| Local Governance | ✅ Zimbabwe-based multisig admin | ❌ Offshore entities |
| Regulatory Compliance | ✅ Full KYC, AML, sanctions | ⚠️ Partial compliance |
| Transparency | ✅ Proof-of-reserve oracle | ⚠️ Limited visibility |
| Enterprise Integration | ✅ Fully programmable & auditable | ⚠️ Limited |
| Peg Integrity | ✅ Fully reserve-backed | ⚠️ Partially reliant on issuer |
